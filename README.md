# Screen Share

Peer to peer screen sharing using WebRTC.

## Prepare

```bash
npm install --force
```
The "force" key is used because the "react-refresh" library does not currently support webpack 5. After it is updated, this can be removed.

## Usage

### Start dev server

```bash
npm start
```

### Start test

```bash
npm test
```

### Build production version

```bash
npm run build
```
